            <p>Git is a fast distributed revision control system.

                This manual is designed to be readable by someone with basic UNIX command-line skills, but no previous
                knowledge of Git.

                Repositories and Branches and Exploring Git history explain how to fetch and study a project using
                git—​read these chapters to learn how to build and test a particular version of a software project,
                search for regressions, and so on.</p>
            <p>Comprehensive reference documentation is available through the man pages, or <strong>git-help[1]</strong>
                command. For example, for the command <strong> git clone < repo> </strong>, you can either use:</p>
            <code>$ man git-clone</code>
            or

            <code>$ git help clone</code>
        </section>

                <p>It will be useful to have a Git repository to experiment with as you read this manual.

                    The best way to get one is by using the <strong>git-clone[1] </strong> command to download a copy of
                    an existing repository. If you don’t already have a project in mind, here are some interesting
                    examples:</p>
                <code># Git itself (approx. 40MB download): 
          <br/>
$ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git
<br/>
	# the Linux kernel (approx. 640MB download):
  <br/>
$ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/<br/>kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git</code>
                <p>The initial clone may be time-consuming for a large project, but you will only need to clone once.

                    The clone command creates a new directory named after the project (git or linux in the examples
                    above). After you cd into this directory, you will see that it contains a copy of the project files,
                    called the working tree, together with a special top-level directory named .git, which contains all
                    the information about the history of the project.</p>

                <p>Git is best thought of as a tool for storing the history of a collection of files. It stores the
                    history as a compressed collection of interrelated snapshots of the project’s contents. In Git each
                    such version is called a commit.

                    Those snapshots aren’t necessarily all arranged in a single line from oldest to newest; instead,
                    work may simultaneously proceed along parallel lines of development, called branches, which may
                    merge and diverge.

                    A single Git repository can track development on multiple branches. It does this by keeping a list
                    of heads which reference the latest commit on each branch; the <strong>git-branch[1]</strong>
                    command shows you the list of branch heads:</p>
                <code>$ git branch
* master</code>
                <p>A freshly cloned repository contains a single branch head, by default named "master", with the
                    working directory initialized to the state of the project referred to by that branch head.

                    Most projects also use tags. Tags, like heads, are references into the project’s history, and can be
                    listed using the <strong> git-tag[1]</strong> command:</p>
                <code>$ git tag -l</code>
                <code>
                    v2.6.11 <br/>
                    v2.6.11-tree <br/>
                    v2.6.12 <br/>
                    v2.6.12-rc2 <br/>
                    v2.6.12-rc3 <br/>
                    v2.6.12-rc4 <br/>
                    v2.6.12-rc5 <br/>
                    v2.6.12-rc6 <br/>
                    v2.6.13 <br/>
                    ...

                <p>Every change in the history of a project is represented by a commit. The <strong>git-show[1]</strong>
                    command shows the most recent commit on the current branch:</p>

                <p>As you can see, a commit shows who made the latest change, what they did, and why.

                    Every commit has a 40-hexdigit id, sometimes called the "object name" or the "SHA-1 id", shown on
                    the first line of the git show output. You can usually refer to a commit by a shorter name, such as
                    a tag or a branch name, but this longer name can also be useful. Most importantly, it is a globally
                    unique name for this commit: so if you tell somebody else the object name (for example in email),
                    then you are guaranteed that name will refer to the same commit in their repository that it does in
                    yours (assuming their repository has that commit at all). Since the object name is computed as a
                    hash over the contents of the commit, you are guaranteed that the commit can never change without
                    its name also changing.

                    In fact, in Git concepts we shall see that everything stored in Git history, including file data and
                    directory contents, is stored in an object with a name that is a hash of its contents.</p>

                <p>Creating, deleting, and modifying branches is quick and easy; here’s a summary of the commands:</p>
